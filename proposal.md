## Problem Statement


We are aiming to solve the problem of active (young) adults who would like to have a partner to exercise with but for whatever reason (new to the area, new to exercise, shy) don’t currently have someone to exercise with. Our target user is a 20 or 30-something year old, moderately active adult who is passionate about fitness and is looking to make their workout routine a social experience.

## Impact

Briefly explain how the project meets a real-world need.

There are a lot of young athletes who like to socialize through activities such as running, cycling, swimming, etc. However, it can often be hard for said young people to meet other athletes to train with. Therefore, this project aims to bring these athletes together through a social network and allow them to bond through shared interests in exercise. This app aims to help foster organic relationships between all levels of athletes while also making exercise more enjoyable, since working out is almost always more fun with a friend.

* Garmin Connect - Network Connections 

Our product will aim to provide an easy user experience in finding individuals in their area to connect over a specific outdoor activity with. The application differs from other “meet-up” style apps by being data-driven in its recommendations for events and people a user would be interested in. Our focus on providing better connections between people, such as a chat capability, will attract a larger user base that want to forge new connections easily.
Another way that our product differs is we avoid the issue in other applications where users can simply claim they are avid runners or otherwise extremely fit regardless of whether they actually are. Since our app will track their activity, we will be able to verify that they are actually running as long and far as they claim. The benefits of this are twofold. One, we will be better able to match users to other users of similar ability levels. Two, this will be an added element of safety that will deter “catfishers”.

## Proposed Solution

Mobile application that utilizes various third-party APIs to compile personal fitness data to connect individuals looking for new connections with others who share their passions in various outdoor activities.

The application will use state-of-art data analytic techniques to provide users with the best recommendations of events and people in their area, based on their skill levels and preferences.

*   Special skills: 
Enjoy working in teams
Organized
I appreciate good aesthetic = slick design for our project
I love gifs so the slack channel will be LIT

*  Workstyle: Like to code with other people/pair programming, but also comfortable coding by myself. 
##### Sara Topic

 * Python, C/C++, VHDL, Perl, Java, SQL
 * Qt Designer (for making GUIs). 
 * I made my first iOs app in Swift for the hack-a-thing last week!
 * My work style is to work in a quiet environment where I can hear myself think. Usually this leads to working alone because collaborative spaces can be loud. Wouldn’t call myself a leader because I’m not confrontational enough to call people out.  
 * Special Skills:
     - I’m really good at writing tests, especially unit tests, also have a ton of experience with Markdown. I love correcting Markdown errors. 
     - Sense of humor
     - Really organized

 * Technical Skills: Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, React, Minimal but increasing experience with React Native
 * Special Skills:
- Good at hunting down bugs in other people’s code
- Helpful and enjoy communicating and working in a team
- Will step up as a leader when necessary 
- Windows user
  * Work Style: I like to work with others and talk through potential ways to implement a feature before starting the implementation. I enjoy helping others whenever it’s needed. I believe communication is key to a successful product.

## Strategy

### Minimum Viable Product Features
 * Specific to running
 * User authentication
 * Create a users profile with pictures, activity oriented questions (Favorite Run?) and allow them to select the data their profile will show
 * Allow users to view & sort other users in their area based on preferred gender, pace, etc. 
 * Capability to chat with other users that they have matched with
 * Capability to block and report users
 * Basic verification of user conduct to ensure no blatant swear words/harassment    
 * Basic matching capability based on preferred pace & routes usually run 
 * Ability for users to create an “event” (run) that other users can join 
 * Basic safety features to ensure the privacy of usernames, passwords, and user health data 
 * Pulling in API data (one API) about users’ activities
 
### Optional Stretch Goals
* Added capability of find biking and swimming partners
* Add a safety-app feature to Apple Watch that will allows users to “check-in” at the end of a run or signal for help if they feel unsafe when meeting a new partner. 
 * using multiple APIs
 
### Testing Plan

* Testing will focus on using the XCode iPhone simulator and associated tools on the Desktop. Further testing will involve downloading the application onto actual phones.

## Implementation Challenges
 
### Development Challenges

* Decision to implement the application using Swift or through React Native
* Accessing third party data for accurate comparison and recommendations of events and people in a user’s area**
* Managing API permissions
* Profile verification
* Formula/logic for ranking recommendations of events and people to a user
* Windows users might have difficulty if we develop for iOS using Swift

### Design Challenges

* Taking minimal manual inputs from user
* Ensuring users feel safe using the application to meet with people in the real world
* Easy to create events that accurately reflects their expectations of what kind of workout they want to accomplish
* Ensuring only good conduct occurs on the app; no harassment, standing people up, etc.
* Matching people via their data but still allowing for a certain degree of privacy

## Meeting Schedule

* Tuesday Time Pending 
* Thursday During Class
